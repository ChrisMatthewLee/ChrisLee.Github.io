	<h1>Reflection</h1>
	
	<p>Overall, this project was relatively easy to do. There were tutorials specifically for this app idea, so they helped a lot. This project probably would've gone by a bit more swiftly if Mr. Edgely was here (^; The hardest part of this project was probably just figuring out the correct format and syntax to make the code do what I wanted it to do. Although this wasn't a written language, it was still a little hard to make certain things like the TinyDB work. Some things that I wished I could've done was made it to where you can save your drawing to the camera roll and I also wish I could've fixed certain glitches such as your drawing disappearing when you change colors or take a new picture.</p>
